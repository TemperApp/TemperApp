The fifths are represented on the outside and thirds on the inside. <br><br> The first temperament selected is located on the inside and the second on the outside, both of which can be exchanged at any time.",
  "howToCompareBottom": "We can compare the fractions of commas affecting fifths by changing the unit  between syntonic comma and Pythagorean comma, as well as those affecting thirds. <br><br> The deviation table shows the number of divergences."
